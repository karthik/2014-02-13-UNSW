Software Carpentry Bootcamp at UNSW
============================

Schedule, installation notes etc TBA.

===============================



This intensive 2-day Software Carpentry bootcamp will introduce attendees to a range of computing skills aimed at making them more productive and efficient in their work. A substantial focus of the workshop will be on improving programming skills in R, but will also include topics on version control, using the shell, and reproducible research. Short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions.

**Who**

The bootcamp is targeted at postgraduate students and other researchers in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.

Please note that this is not an introductory R course and in order to get the most out of the bootcamp, attendees should have at least a basic knowledge of programming in R. However, please don't let that scare you off - if you'd like to attend but have never used R before, working through the online material covered in ['Day 1' of the NiceR code 'Introduction to R'] (http://nicercode.github.io/modules/#introduction-to-r-macquarie-university-2013) will get you up to speed!

**Cost**

To avoid last minute drop-outs, all attendees are asked to pay a token $20 'deposit'. This will go towards an evening function (couple of drinks at the pub) at the end of the second day. Instructions on how to pay will be sent out after registration. Thanks! 

**Requirements**

Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed. (The list will be sent to participants a week before the boot camp.)

**Instructors** 

[Karthik Ram] (http://nature.berkeley.edu/~kram): quantitative ecologist at UC Berkeley broadly interested in the structure and dynamics of food webs in terrestrial systems. He blogs at Inundata, and is also the co-founder of [rOpenSci] (http://ropensci.org/), a project which aims to foster reproducible research and data reuse through open source software tools.
 
[Daniel Falster] (http://dfalster.github.io/): post-doc at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. He uses a combination of math, computer models, and large data sets to test fundamental ideas about the processes shaping terrestrial vegetation and plant diversity. He is passionate about science, open data, reproducible research, and teaching biologists to code.
 
[Rich FitzJohn] (http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/): postdoc with Mark Westoby at Macquarie University. He recently completed a PhD with Sally Otto in the Zoology department and Biodiversity Research Centre at UBC.
