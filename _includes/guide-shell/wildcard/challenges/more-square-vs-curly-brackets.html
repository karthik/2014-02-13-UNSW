  We also discussed the effect of running
  <code>ls file[AB].txt</code> when neither the file
  <code>fileA.txt</code>, nor the file <code>fileB.txt</code>,
  nor the file <code>file[AB].txt</code> existed.
  What would be the effect of running
  <code>ls file{A,B}.txt</code> under these
  circumstances?
