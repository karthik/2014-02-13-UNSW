<p>
  In the lesson we started in an empty directory and created 
  several files using the command:
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file{4,6,7}.txt file{a..e}.txt</span>
$
</pre>

<p>
  What files, if any, would have been created if we had instead
  used square brackets?  I.e.
</p>

<pre>
$ <span class="in">touch file[467].txt file[a-e].txt</span>
$
</pre>
